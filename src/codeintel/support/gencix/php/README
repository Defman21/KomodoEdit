# How to generate PHPUnit cix catalog

1. Download a zip file of PHPUnit source.
2. run `ci2 scan -fpnr /path/to/phpunit/src/Framework > phpunit-X.cix`
3. Open the cix file and add `description` and `name` attributes to the
   top-level "codeintel" tag.
4. Also search for "Warning.php" and "Exception.php" and remove the second
   occurrences of each since catalog.py will throw assertion errors that there
   is more than one.
5. Run the PHP test suite (`python test.py test_php`) and ensure all is well.
